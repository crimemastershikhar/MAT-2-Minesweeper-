## About the Game
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle text based game built via C++. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field

## Rules of the Game
- The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly distributed.
- To win, you need to open all the cells.
- The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that contain mines.
